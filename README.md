# Pixel Art Soul *(Working Title)*

**Pixel Art Soul** is a 2D isometric pixel art game set on a space colony built on an asteroid or moon.  
Unlike traditional Soulsborne games, you **play as the final boss**—growing more powerful as you defeat invading heroes.

## 🕹️ Game Concept

This is a **reverse Soulsborne-style** action game inspired by titles like *The Dark Queen of Mortholme*, but with deeper progression mechanics. Instead of a static final boss, your character evolves, unlocking new weapons and branching upgrade trees.

### Planned Features:
- ⚔️ Multiple unlockable player characters, each with unique abilities
- 🌲 A deep upgrade tree to enhance abilities and weapons
- 💾 Save system for persistent progression
- 🪐 Atmospheric sci-fi setting on a desolate space colony

## ✅ Current Features

- Basic player movement
- Enemy spawning system
